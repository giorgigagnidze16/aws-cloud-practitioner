# IP Addresses with AWS 

IPv4 - Internet Protocol Version 4, 4.3 Billion IP Addresses

Private IPv4 can be used on LAN such as internal networking, it is constant within your AWS instances

For EC2 instances if we stop and start instance public IPv4 will be changed

Private IPv4's are fixed for EC2 instances, even after stop/start

### Elastic IP - Allows to attach a fixed public IPv4 addresses to EC2 instances

	If left attached to EC2 instance, no need to pay, but if EC2 is stopped or it is not even attached to anything then we will have ongoing cost

IPv6 -  Internet Protocol Version 4, Every IP is public (there is no private range)

# VPC & Subnets Primer

A VPC is a virtual private cloud, private network to deploy the resources in, i.e EC2 instances, it is linked to a specific region

Subnets allow to partition the network inside the VPC (AZ Resource)

Public subnet is accessible from the internet

Private subnet is not accessible from the internet

To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use route tables

# Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways

Internet gateways helps the VPC instances connect with the internet

NAT Gateways (Managed By AWS) or NAT Instances allow our instances in our private subnet access internet while being private 

# Security Groups & NACL

NACL - Network ACL - A firewall that controls traffic from and to subnet

Can Have: Allow or Deny rules

Are attached at Subnet level

Rules only include IP addresses

It's stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed from the rules

<hr>
### Security Groups

A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 instance

Can only have allow rules

Rules IP addresses or other security groups

It's stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules

# VPC FlowLogs & VPC Peering

Capture IP traffic going into your interfaces
	VPC Flow Logs
	Subnet Flow Logs
	Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs

Helps troubleshooting of connectivity issues

Data can go into S3, CloudWatch logs and Kinesis data firehose

## VPC Peering

Is used to connect two VPC's and behave as if they're in the same network

Must not overlap IP ranges

VPC Peering is not transitive

# VPC Endpoints - Interface & Gateway

Allows to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of public 

VPC Endpoint Gateway is for only S3 and DynamoDB ONLY!, Interface can be used for any others

# AWS PrivateLink

Scalable way of exposing a service to 1000s of VPCs

Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, etc.

ENI - Elastic Network Interface 

# Direct Connect & Site to Site VPN

Hybrid Cloud stuff, 

Example: want to connect on premises to the VPC

a. We can use site to site VPN
b. Direct Connect (DX) - establish physical connection between two, goes over private network, takes at least a month

We need on-premises CUSTOMER GATEWAY (CGW) and on AWS we need Virtual Private Gateway or VGW, then connect with site to site VPN

# AWS Client VPN

use OpenVPN to connect to private network

# Transit Gateway

for having transitive peering between 1000's of VPCs and On-Premises hub-and-spoke (start) connection

EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

EC2 Sizing & Configuration: 

	Operating System (OS) - Linux, Windows, Mac OS
	RAM
	Storage: EBS & EFS, Hardware
	Network Card
	Firewall rules: Security Groups
	Bootsrap script: User Data

<hr>

## EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data is a script that bootstraps EC2 instances on its first launch

launching commands when the machine starts, it is only run once, at the instance first start

Do so for: Software Updates, Installs, Downloading common files, etc..

it runs with sudo rights

<hr>

Public IPv4 addresses are used to access the EC2 instances from the public

Periodically Public IP changes on EC2 instance restart 

# EC2 Instance Types

1. General Purpose
2. Compute Optimized
3. Memory Optimized
4. Storage Optimized

General Purpose - great for web servers and code repositories, balance between:
	Compute
	Memory
	Networking

Compute Optimized - optimized for batch processing workloads, transcoding, high performance, machine learning, gaming servers, (CPU optimized)

Memory optimized - high performance dbs, rdbms, cache stores, in-memory dbs, real-time processing of big unstructured data

Storage Optimized - Relational & NoSQL databases, caches, distributed file systems, etc

# Security Groups

Fundamental parts of the network security in AWS

Controlling traffic in / out of the EC2 instances

they are firewall on EC2 instances

They regulate: 
	Access to ports
	IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
	Inbound network
	Outbound network

Note:

Security groups can be attached to multiple instances, and an instance can have multiple security groups.

Security groups are locked down to a region / VPC combination

Good idea is to maintain one separate group for SSH access

If we get time out then its a security group issue, else if connection refused is returned, then it is application error maybe not launched or else...

<hr>

# Ports to know

22 = SSH (Secure Shell)

21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share

22 = SFTP - Upload files using SSH

80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites

443 = HTTPS - access secured websites

3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance

<hr>

# IAM Roles For EC2 Instances


Modify IAM Role for EC2 instance for example to read aws iam list-users

<hr>

# EC2 Purchasing Options

On-demand Instances - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
Reserved (1 & 3 Years)
	Reserved instances - long workloads
	Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instance types
Savings Plans (1 & 3 Years) - Commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
Spot Instances - short workloads, cheapest, can lose instances (less reliable)
Dedicated Hosts - Book an entire physical server, control instance placement
Dedicated Instances - No other customers will share hardware
Capacity Reservations - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

---

## EC2 On Demand

Linux or Windows - billing per second after the first minute
Other OS - Billing per hour

Highest cost, no upfront payments and long term commitments

Great for: short-term, un-interrupted workloads where we cant predict how application behaves

---

## EC2 Reserved Instances

Around 72% Discount than On-Demand

We reserve specific instance attributes, for example: Instance type, region, tenancy, OS

Reservation Period - 1 (+discount) - 3 years (+++discount)
Payment options - No Upfront(+), Partial Upfront(++), All Upfront(+++)

Reserved instance's Scope - Regional or Zonal, (reserve capacity in AZ)

Recommended for steady-state applications (databases for example)

Can be bought or sold on Reserved instance marketplace

> Convertible Reserved Instance allows to change attributes, less discount but more flexible

---

## EC2 Savings Plan

Get a discount based on long-term usage

Commit to a certaion type of usage (10$/hour for 1 or 3 years)

Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price

Locked to a specific instance family & AWS Region (for example M5, in us-east-1)

Flexible across: Instance size m5.xlarge, 2xlarge, OS, Tenancy

---
## Spot Instances

Can get up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand

Instances can be lost at any point of time, you define max price we are willing to pay for spot instances, if spot price goes over it, we will lose it

The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS

Good for:

	Batch Jobs
	Data analytics
	Image processing
	Any distributed workloads
	Flexible start-end time workloads

Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

---
## EC2 Dedicated Hosts

A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to our use

Allows to address compliance requirements and use existing server-bound software licenses, per-socket, per-core, and etc.

Purchasing Options:
	On-demand: Pay per second for active dedicated host
	Reserved - 1 or 3 years
The most expensive option

Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring Your Own License)

Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

---

## EC2 Dedicated Instances

Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you

May share hardware with other instances in the same account

No control over instance placement

---

## EC2 Capacity Reservations

Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in specific AZ for any duration
Always have an access to EC2 capacity when needed,
No time commitment, no billing discounts
Combine with Regional Reserved Instances  and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
Charged at On-Demand whether you run instances or not

Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

AMI - OS

Instance Size - CPU + RAM

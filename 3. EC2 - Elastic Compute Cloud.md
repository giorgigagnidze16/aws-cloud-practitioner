EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

EC2 Sizing & Configuration: 

	Operating System (OS) - Linux, Windows, Mac OS
	RAM
	Storage: EBS & EFS, Hardware
	Network Card
	Firewall rules: Security Groups
	Bootsrap script: User Data

<hr>

## EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data is a script that bootstraps EC2 instances on its first launch

launching commands when the machine starts, it is only run once, at the instance first start

Do so for: Software Updates, Installs, Downloading common files, etc..

it runs with sudo rights

<hr>

Public IPv4 addresses are used to access the EC2 instances from the public

Periodically Public IP changes on EC2 instance restart 

# EC2 Instance Types

1. General Purpose
2. Compute Optimized
3. Memory Optimized
4. Storage Optimized

General Purpose - great for web servers and code repositories, balance between:
	Compute
	Memory
	Networking

Compute Optimized - optimized for batch processing workloads, transcoding, high performance, machine learning, gaming servers, (CPU optimized)

Memory optimized - high performance dbs, rdbms, cache stores, in-memory dbs, real-time processing of big unstructured data

Storage Optimized - Relational & NoSQL databases, caches, distributed file systems, etc

# Security Groups

Fundamental parts of the network security in AWS

Controlling traffic in / out of the EC2 instances

they are firewall on EC2 instances

They regulate: 
	Access to ports
	IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
	Inbound network
	Outbound network

Note:

Security groups can be attached to multiple instances, and an instance can have multiple security groups.

Security groups are locked down to a region / VPC combination

Good idea is to maintain one separate group for SSH access

If we get time out then its a security group issue, else if connection refused is returned, then it is application error maybe not launched or else...

# Ports to know

22 = SSH (Secure Shell)

21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share

22 = SFTP - Upload files using SSH

80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites

443 = HTTPS - access secured websites

3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance

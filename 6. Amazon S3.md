### Use Cases:

	Backup and Storage
	Disaster Recovery
	Archive
	Hybrid Cloud Storage
	Host Applications
	Media Hosting
	Data Leaks & big data analytics
	Software Delivery
	Static website hosting


## Buckets

Buckets must have <b>Globally</b> unique name (Across all regions, all accounts)

Buckets are defined at Region level

Max object size is 5TB, for greated than 5TB, must use "multi-part uploading"

## Amazon S3 Security - Bucket Policies

User Based 
	IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for users from IAM
Resource Based
	S3 Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from S3 console
	Object Access Control List - ACL - finer grain, can be disabled

Encryption: Encrypt objects with encryption keys

JSON Based Policies

## Static Website Hosting

S3 can host static websites and have them accessible from the internet

## S3 Versioning

Enable versioning to avoid accidental deletions, just add delete marker, or go back to previous version

Remove delete marker to restore the Object

## S3 Replication

CRR, SRR 

must enable versioning in source and target bucket

Copying is asynchronous

Must give proper IAM permissions to S3

### CRR - Cross Region Replication


### SRR - Same Region Replication 


# S3 Storage Classes

1. S3 Standard - General Purpose - 99.99% available, for frequently accessed data, low latency, sustain 2 facility failures, big data analytics, mobile & gaming apps, etc..
2. S3 Standard - Infrequent Access - less frequent accessible data but with rapid access, less expensive, cost on retrieval, 99.9% available, Disaster recovery, backups
3. S3 One Zone IA - Data lost if AZ is lost, 99.5% Available, for data that we can recreate 
4. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval - Low cost for archiving and backup, price for storage + retrieval, MS retrieval, min. storage = 90 Days
5. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval - 3 options, Expedited (1-5 Mins), Standard (3-5 Hours), Bulk (5 to 12 Hours) - Bulk is free. Min storage = 90 days
6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive - Standard 12 HRs, Bulk 48 Hrs, Lowest cost, min. storage = 120 Days
7. S3 Intelligent Tiering - Small monitoring fee, automatically moves objects between tiers, no retrieval charges

Can move between classes manually or use S3 lifecycle configurations

Durability: 99.9999999% 11 9's. of objects across multiple AZ
Store 10 mil, objects in S3, expect to lose single object once every 10,000 years

# AWS Snow Family

Highly secure, portable devices to COLLECT and process data at the edge and migrate data into and out of AWS

### Data Migration:

Snowcone

Snowball Edge

Snowmobile

### Edge Computing:

# Snowcone

Snowball Edge

#### Rule Of Thumb: If it takes more than a week to transfer a data over the network, use Snowball devices for example

Snowballs - TBs or PBs of data in/out of AWS

Pay per data transfer

Provide block storage or S3 compatible object storage

Snowball Edge, Storage Optimized: 80 TB HDD

Snowball Edge, Compute Optimized: 42TB HDD, 24 TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 object storage

Use for large data cloud migration, disaster recovery, etc.

# Snowcone

Small, portable computing anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments

Used for edge computing, storage and data transfer

Snowcone - 8 TB of HDD Storage

Snowcone SSD - 14 TB of SSD Storage

Either send back to AWS offline by shipping or use AWS DataSync via internet to send data

---
# Snowmobile

Transfer exabytes of data 1EB = 1000 PB

Each snowmobile has 100PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)

High security, GPS, 24/7 Surveillance

Better than Snowball if transferring more than 10PB of data

---
# Edge Computing

Process data at edge locations while it is producing

Snowcone & Snowcone SSD

2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, wired / wireless access

USB-c powered / or battery

---
Snowball edge

Compute Optimized:

104 vCPUs, 416 GiB of RAM
Optional GPU
28 TB NVMe or 42 TB HDD

Storage Optimized:
40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM
80 TB Storage

All devices can run EC2 instances or Lambda functions via AWS IoT Greengrass

Long term deployment options for discounted prices 1-3 years

# Hybrid Cloud for Storage

AWS is pushing for "hybrid cloud"

Part of the infrastructure on-premises, part on the cloud

Due to:
	Long migrations
	Security requirements
	Compliance requirements
	IT Strategy

Expose S3 to on-premises via Storage gateway


### AWS Storage Gateway - Bridge between on-premise and cloud data in S3

Amazon EBS, S3, Glacier

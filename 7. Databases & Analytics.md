Storing data on disk can have its limits

You can structure the data 

Build indexes to efficiently query / search through the data

Define relationships between datasets

Databases are optimized for a purpose

---
## Relational Databases

Just like Excel spreadsheets, with links between them

Use SQL language to perform queries / lookups

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational databases

NoSQL dbs have flexible schemas for building modern applications

# AWS RDS - Relational Database Service

 Managed Database Service

	PostgreSQL
	MySQL
	MariaDB
	Oracle DB
	Microsoft SQL Server
	Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)


RDS is managed, continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp
Monitoring Dashboards, Read replicas for improved read performance

Multi AZ setup for Disaster Recover

Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io 1)

Cant SSH into our dbs

---
# Amazon Aurora

Aurora is proprietary technology from AWS, not open source

Supports PostgreSQL and MySQL

It is cloud optimized, 5x performance with MySQL on RDS, and 3x of PostgreSQL on RDS

Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10Gb, up to 128TB

Aurora costs more than RDS, 20% but is more efficient

Not In the free tier

We can create database snapshots, create / restore database from snapshots

Databases can be copied between regions

---
# RDS Deployments: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ

Read Replicas:

	Scale the read workloads of your DB

Distributing reads between databases, can create up to 15 Read Replicas

Data is only written to the main database

Multi-AZ

	Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)

Read / Write from the same database, Replicate in cross AZ, aka Failover DB

If first DB fails then Failover DB will be used in different AZ

Data is written and read from main database

---
# Multi-Region

Replication between regions, writing still occurs in the main database from the main region but read is done from replica databases

Disaster recovery, Local Performance

There is a replication costs

---
# ElastiCache

It is like Redis or Memcached databases

They are in-memory databases with high performance, low latency

Helps reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads

---
# DynamoDB

It is a NoSQL database, with replication across 3 AZs

Scales to massive workloads, distributed "Serverless" database

Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of rows, 100s of TB of storage

Fast and consistent in performance

Single-digit millisecond latency - low latency retrieval

integrated with IAM

Low cost and auto scaling capabilities

### It is a KEY : Value Database

---
# DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX

Fully managed, in-memory cache for DynamoDB for even faster performance, 10x performance boost


## DynamoDB Global Tables

Make tables accessible with low latency in multiple-regions

It is possible to create replication for global table

---
# Redshift

Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but not for OLTP - online transaction processing

It's OLAP - online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)

Load data once ever hour, not second 

10x better performance than other warehouses

#### Columnar storage of data

Massively parallel query execution MPP, highly available

Has a SQL interface for performing the queries

---
# EMR - Elastic MapReduce

EMR helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process vast amount of data

Clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances

Supports Spark, HBase, etc...

Auto Scaling and integrated with Spot Instances

Use Cases: data processing, machine learning, web indexing, big data...

---
# Amazon Athena

Serverless query service to perform analytics against S3 objects

Uses SQL language

Supports CSV, JSON, AVRO and Parquet

Pricing: 5$ per TB of data scanned

Use compressed or columnar data for cost-savings

Use cases: BI / analytics / reporting, analyze & query VPC Flow logs etc...

---
# QuickSight - Serverless machine learning-powered BI service to create interactive dashboards

Allows creating dashboards on our databases

---
# DocumentDB

DocumentDB is the "AWS-Implementation" for MongoDB, a NoSQL database

Used to store, query and index JSON data

automatically grows in increments of 10GBS up to 64TB

Scales to workloads of millions of requests per seconds

---
# Neptune Overview

Graph database

Graph dataset would be a social network

Highly available across 3AZ, with up to 15 replicas

great for knowledge graphs, fraud detection, recommendations engine, social networking

---
# QLDB - Quantum Ledger Database

A ledger is book recording financial transactions

used to review history of all the changes made to your application data

Data written is immutable

Good for tracking transactions , 2-3x better performance than other frameworks, uses SQL

---
# Managed Blockchain Overview

Decentralization, works with Etherium and Hyperledger FABRIC

---
# AWS Glue

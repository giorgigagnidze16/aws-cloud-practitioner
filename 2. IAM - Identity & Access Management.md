## IAM: Users & Groups

Users are people in your organization that can be grouped

## IAM: Permissions

Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents or IAM policies

Enforce: LEAST Privilege Principle

## IAM: Policies

A user can be or can be not attached to the group, in these cases we can apply them with inline policies

IAM Policy Structure:
	Version
	ID
	Statements
		Sid
		Effect: Allow or Deny an access to certain API
		Principal: AWS Account which to these policies are applied
		Action: List of Actions these policy Allows / Denies
		Resources: List of Resources which these policy applies to

## IAM: MFA

IAM - Password Policy  = Higher security

MFA = Multi Factor Authentication = Password + security device we own

Virtual MFA device
UTF Key  - Universal 2nd Factor Security Key - Physical Device
Hardware Key Fob

# Accessing AWS

1. AWS Console
2. AWS CLI
3. AWS SDK

Generate access keys for users and configure AWS

AWS CloudShell is WEB based alternative to AWS CLI

# IAM Roles for Services

Some AWS Services will need to perform actions on your behalf, to do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with<b> IAM Roles </b>(I.e [[3. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud]] Instances)

Common roles:
	[[3. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud]] Instance Roles
	Lambda Function Roles
	CloudFormation Roles

# IAM Security Tools

## IAM Credentials Report (account-level)

Lists users and status of their credentials

## IAM Access Advisor (per user)

Shows the service permissions granted to user and when they were last accessed (helps with least privilege principle)

# IAM Best Practices:

	Do not use root account except for AWS account setup
	One physical user = One AWS user
	Assign users to groups and assing permissions to groups
	Create a strong password policy
	Enforce using of MFA
	Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
	Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
	Audit using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
	Never share IAM users & Access keys

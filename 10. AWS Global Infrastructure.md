Decreased Latency

Good for: Disaster Recovery (DR) plan, increased availability

Attack Protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack

Global DNS, Route 53: Great to route users to the closest deployment with lowest latency and disaster recovery strategies

Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront

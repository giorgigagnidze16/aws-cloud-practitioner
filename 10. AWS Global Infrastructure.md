# Why make a global application?

A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies

On AWS: this could be Regions / Edge Locations

Decreased Latency

Good for: Disaster Recovery (DR) plan, increased availability

Attack Protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack

---

Global DNS, Route 53: Great to route users to the closest deployment with lowest latency and disaster recovery strategies

Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
	Replicate Part of an application to AWS Edge Locations for lower latency
	Cache common requests and lower latency and have better experience

S3 Transfer Acceleration - Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3

AWS Global Accelerator - Improve global application availability

# AWS Route 53

Route 53 is managed DNS

DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server via URLs

## Routing Policies 

1. Simple Routing Policy - No health checks, request and get an IP back
2. Weighted Routing Policy - Distribute the traffic between EC2 instances, assign weights to EC2 instances as a "priority"
3. Latency Routing Policy - Route users to the closest deployment, minimize latency 
4. Failover routing policy, have Primary and Failover instance, DNS does health check on primary and if it fails, redirects to failover instance

# AWS CloudFront

CloudFront - Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge

Improves experience

AWS Has lots of points of presence, or edge locations

Has DDOS Protection, integrated with Shield and Web application firewall

S3 buckets can restrict access to only CloudFront with Origin access control 

---
# S3 Transfer Acceleration

Increase transfer speed by transferring file to AWS Edge location that forwards data to S3 in the target region

---
# AWS Global Accelerator

Improve global application availability and performance

Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to our application

Client -> Edge Location -> Application

2 static Anycast IPs are created for applications

---
# AWS Outposts

Outposts are server racks provided by AWS that offer same AWS infrastructure and applications just like AWS

AWS Provides REAL PHYSICAL, on-premises infrastructure 

---
# AWS WaveLength

WaveLength zones are infrastructure deployments within the 5G network areas

---
# AWS Local Zone

Place AWS compute, storage, database and other services closer to end users to run latency-sensitive applications

Extension of AWS Region

for example, local zones: Boston, Chicago, Dallas, etc.

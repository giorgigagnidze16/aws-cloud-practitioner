# CloudFormation

CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining AWS infrastructure for any resources

For example:

Security Groups

EC2 Instances

S3 Buckets

ELB, etc.

Then CloudFormation creates all for you, following the given order and specified configuration

Benefits:

Infrastructure as code
	No resources are manually created
	Changes are reviewed through code

Cost:
	Each resource is tagged so its easier to see and manage costs
	Estimate costs, using CloudFormation template
	Savings strategy

Productivity
	Ability to destroy and recreate infrastructure on the fly
	Declarative programming

Leverage existing templates on the web & documentation

Scalability means that application / system can handle greater loads by adapting

There are two kinds of scalability:

	Vertical
	Horizontal (elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to high availability

Vertical scalability is common for non distributed systems such as database.

## Horizontal Scalability

Increase numbers of instances instead of sizes
It is used in distributed systems

---
# High Availability

High availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling

High availability means running application / system in at least 2 AZs

Goal: Survive data center loss

---

# High Availability & Scalability

Vertical Scaling = Increasing instance size (= scale up / down)

Horizontal Scaling = Adding more instances (= scale in / out)
	Auto Scaling Groups
	Load Balancer

High Availability: Run instances for the same Application across multi AZ
	Auto Scaling Groups - In Multi AZ
	Load Balancer - In Multi AZ

## Definitions:

Scalability: ability to accommodate a larger load by scaling up or scaling out

Elasticity: once a system is scalable, elasticity means there will be some "auto-scaling", This is cloud-friendly: pay-per-use, match demands, optimize costs

Agility: New IT Resources are only a click away, resources are available instantly

# ELB - Elastic Load Balancing

Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances)


## Why To Use?

	Spread load across multiple downstream instances
	Expose a single point of access (DNS) to the application
	Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
	Do regular health checks to your instances

An ELB is a managed load balancer
	AWS guarantees that it will be working
	AWS Takes care of upgrades, maintenance and high availability
	AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

It is less expensive to set up your OWN load balancer but will need more effort for maintenance, upgrades and etc.

## 4 Kinds Of Load Balancers on AWS

1. Application Load Balancer - HHTP/HTTPS, gRPC, Static DNS (URL) Load Balancer, Layer 7
2. Network Load Balancer - TCP/UDP, Ultra-High performance, millions of requests per second, Static IP through Elastic IP, Layer 4
3. Gateway Load Balancer - GENEVE Protocol on IP Packets, Route traffic on Firewalls that we manage on EC2 instances, Intrusion Detection, Analyze Traffic, Layer 3
4. Deprecated: Classic Load Balancer - Layer 4 & 7

REGISTER EC2s to the TARGET Groups and then assign it to the LOAD BALANCER

# Auto Scaling Groups - ASG 

Loads can change over time

Scale In or Out with ASG, run min and max number of machines

Automatically register new instances to a load balancer

Replace Unhealthy instances

Cost savings: only run at an optimal capacity

# Scaling Strategies for ASG

Manual Scaling: Update Size of ASG Manually

Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
	Simple / Step Scaling
		When CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%, then add 2 units)
		When CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%, then remove 1 units)

Target Tracking Scaling
	Example: I want the AVG ASG CPU to stay at  around 40%

Scheduled Scaling
	Scale based on known usage patterns on forecasted 

Predictive Scaling
	Uses Machine Learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
	Automatically provision the right number of EC2 instances in advance

Scalability means that application / system can handle greater loads by adapting

There are two kinds of scalability:

	Vertical
	Horizontal (elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to high availability

Vertical scalability is common for non distributed systems such as database.

## Horizontal Scalability

Increase numbers of instances instead of sizes
It is used in distributed systems

---
# High Availability

High availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling

High availability means running application / system in at least 2 AZs

Goal: Survive data center loss

---

# High Availability & Scalability

Vertical Scaling = Increasing instance size (= scale up / down)

Horizontal Scaling = Adding more instances (= scale in / out)
	Auto Scaling Groups
	Load Balancer

High Availability: Run instances for the same Application across multi AZ
	Auto Scaling Groups - In Multi AZ
	Load Balancer - In Multi AZ

## Definitions:

Scalability: ability to accommodate a larger load by scaling up or scaling out

Elasticity: once a system is scalable, elasticity means there will be some "auto-scaling", This is cloud-friendly: pay-per-use, match demands, optimize costs

Agility: New IT Resources are only a click away, resources are available instantly

# ELB - Elastic Load Balancing

Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers

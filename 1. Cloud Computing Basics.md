Cloud computing is an on-demand delivery of computer power, database storage, applications and other IT resources

Pay-as-you-go pricing model

# Cloud Models

## 1. Private Cloud

Cloud services not exposed to public

## 2. Public Cloud

Resources are accessible from the internet

Providers - AWS, GCP, Azure

## 3. Hybrid Cloud

Keep some servers and use clouds as well

Control over sensitive content

# Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. On-demand self service 
2. Broad network access
3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling (share applications and hardware and retain security)
4. Rapid elasticity and scalability
5. Measured service

# Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade CAPEX for OPEX
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacities
4. Increased speed and agility
5. Pay for what you use and shut down if instances are not used

# Types of Cloud Computing

IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service: Building blocks for cloud IT  - [[3. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud]]
PaaS - Platform as a Service: Manage deployment & application management - Elastic Beanstalk
SaaS - Software as a Service - Run and managed by service provider - Rekognition, Gmail, etc.

# Pricing of the Cloud

1. Compute - Pay for compute time
2. Storage - Pay for data stored in the cloud
3. Data Transfer - Pay for data transfer OUT of the cloud, IN is free

# AWS Global Infrastructure

	AWS Regions
	AWS Availability Zones
	AWS Data Centers
	AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence

Regions: us-east-1, eu-west-3, a region is a cluster of Data Centers

## When Choosing AWS Region, Consider:

Compliance with data governance and legal requirements, some data can not leave the country for example

Proximity: reduced latency

Available Services: AWS Services are region based

Pricing: Pricing varies region to region

## AWS Availability Zones

Each region has 3 - 6 availability zones: eu-west-1a, eu-west-1b...

Each AZ is one or more discrete data center with redundant power networking and connectivity

AZs are separate from each other, so they're isolated

Connected with high bandwidth, low latency network

## AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

Content delivery with the lowest latency possible

<hr>

# Global Services

	[[2. IAM - Identity & Access Management]]
	Route 53
	CloudFront
	WAF

# Shared Responsibility Model

Customer is responsible for security IN the cloud, AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud

No illegal content, and harmful use is allowed, no abusing, etc.

# EBS - Elastic Block Store is a Network drive that can be attached to instances while they run

Allows data persistence, even after EC2 instances are terminated
They can only be mounted to ONE instance at a time and they're locked / bound to specific AZ so one from us-east-1a can't be attached to us-east-1b, use snapshots instead

It is a network drive, there might be a bit of latency

Can be detached and attached between instances

Locked to the specific AZ

Has a provisioned capacity, GBs, IOPS

Get billed for provisioned capacity

## Delete on Termination attribute

By default, the ROOT volume is deleted and other attached ones are not deleted

# EBS Snapshots 

Make back-ups for your EBS volume at a point in time

Not necessary to detach volume to snapshot, but recommended

Can copy snapshots across AZs or Regions

## EBS Snapshot Options

EBS Storage Archive - move snapshot to an "Archive tier", 75% cheaper, takes 24 - 72 Hours to restore from the archive

Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots - Rules to retain deleted snapshots so it can be recovered after an accidental deletion, Retention (1 Day - 1 Year)

Can be copied between regions

### Can Recreate a Volume from Snapshot

# AMI = Amazon Machine Image

AMIs are customization of EC2 instances
	Faster boot & Config time because all the software is pre-packaged

AMIs are built for a specific regions, can be copied across them

We can launch EC2 instances from:

	A Public AMI: AWS Provided (Amazon Linux for Example)
	Make your own AMI: make and maintain yourself
	Launch from AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made

## The AMI Process

1. Start EC2 and Customize It
2. Stop the EC2 instance (for data integrity)
3. Build an AMI - will also create EBS snapshots
4. Launch instances from other AMIs

# EC2 Image Builder

Used to automate the creation of VMS or container images

=> Automate the creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs

Can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updating... )

It is a FREE service, only pay for resources (for example, created EC2s, pay for AMI storage)

# EC2 Instance Store

EBS drives are network drives so it might cause a bit of delay

If we want a high-performance Hardware disk attached to our instance we need to use EC2 Instance Store

Better I/O Performance

EC2 Instances lose the storage if they're stopped, not good for long term data

Good for cache, temporary content, etc.

Risk of data loss if hardware fails

Backups and replications are your responsibilities


# EFS - Elastic File System

Managed NFS - Network File System - that can be mounted to more than once EC2 instance
at the same time

EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
pay per use, no capacity planning, available and highly scalable


# EBS vs EFS

EBS can only be attached to one instance in one specific AZ, they're bound to specific AZ's, can be copied with Snapshots

EFS is SHARED network file system, it is shared between EC2 instances in multiple different AZ's


# EFS Infrequent Access

It is a cost optimized storage class that we don't access very often, gives up to 92% discount than EFS standard

Once enabled, EFS will automatically move files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed and a LIFECYCLE Policy

They are transparent to applications accessing EFS


# Amazon FSx

Launch 3rd party, High-Performance file systems on AWS

Fully managed service

FSx for Windows File Server = fully managed, windows native shared file system, for windows instances, SUPPORTS: SMB Protocol & Windows NTFS, Integrated with Azure AD

can be accessed from on-premises windows infrastructure

===

FSx for Lustre - fully managed, high-performance, scalable file storage for High Performance Computing (HPC)

Good for: Machine Learning, Video Processing, Analytics, etc...

Scales up to 100s GB/s, Millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
